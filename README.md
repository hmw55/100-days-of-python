# 100-days-of-python

## Days 1 - 10

### Day 1
- This is a beginner-friendly Python project that introduces basic concepts like printing, user input, and string manipulation through a fun and interactive name generator.
    - One thing that I changed from the original is using "," instead of "+" for string concactenation.


### Day 2
- This project is a simple tip calculator that takes the total bill, desired tip percentage, and number of people splitting the bill. It then calculates how much each person should pay, demonstrating the use of user input, type conversion, arithmetic operations, and rounding in Python
    - I simplified the original code by removing unnecessary intermediate variables, renaming tip_as_percent to a more concise tip_rate, calculating the total bill in one step, and using an f-string with .2f formatting to correctly display the final amount with two decimal places.
